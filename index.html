    <h3>Our First Home</h3>
    <p>My husband and I purchased our first home together during the COVID pandemic in 2020. We tried finding an established home, but after a seemingly <em>endless</em> amount of searching and homes that were listed tremendously over asking price, we decided to move out west and build our own house in Haymarket, Virginia.</p>
    <p>This year for his birthday, I got him a picture of our soon-to-be home. A friend painted this for me based off of a description I gave her. It's amazing to see how similar it looks to the way our home turned out!</p>

    <p>This is what our house ended up looking like. It is not completely done, but it is 99% of the way there. Artists really are so amazing with the attention to detail and ability to listen, then create.</p>

    <h4>Our Story</h4>
    <p>I never thought I would build a home, but after two deployments and a long time of living in a townhouse, we decided it was time to settle down and find our forever home. Since we have committed to living there for at least the next decade, we figured we should love it. 
    <p>I have always enjoyed interior deisgn and watching <i>HGTV.</i> After all, my mom was an interior designer, so I grew up around all things home design. I <em>never in a million years</em> thought I would be able to create my own home one day, though. I knew it would be a lot of work, but also that it would be a once in a lifetime thing I was lucky enough to be able to do.</p>
    <p>My husband, Robert, and I met online in 2015, right before he went on his first deployment to the Middle East. This was also two years after I got diagnosed with a debilitating chronic illness called POTS (Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome). Being away from each other that early on in our relationship was the hardest thing I've ever had to do, but it was so worth it to end up getting married to the love of my life a few short years later.</p>
    <p>After less than a year of being married, we found out that he was about to prepare for <em>another</em> deployment. This one was not nearly as far, but it was longer -- a year and a half, to be exact! Little did we know that the coronavirus pandemic would hit right in the middle of all of this. To say that our life together has been hectic would be an understatement. We are so ready to be <b>settled.</b></p>

    <h4>Deciding to Build</h4>
    <p>The decision to build a home was not an easy one. The entire northern Virginia area is so expensive to live in, and we had a really hard time sticking to the budget and staying close to our normal Fairfax, Virginia address. So, we decided to go out a little further to get more land and a little more <em>bang for our buck.</em> I am a city girl at heart, so this was not the easiest decision, but I am falling in love with the quaint little town and everything it has to offer.</p>
    <p>Before deciding to build, we listed some pros and cons. Here are my final lists:
    </p>
    <h5>Pros to Building</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>We get to have exactly what we want in a home.</li>
        <li>We know exactly what we will be paying and don't have to battle it out with other people interested in the home.</li>
        <li>We also get to choose our land, and can have a <b>big</b> yard for our chocolate lab, Jax.</li>
        </ul>
    <h5>Cons to Building</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>It takes much longer than finding an established house and closing within a week or month.</li>
        <li>The rates are at an all-time low and we really want to be able to take advantage of this. We can't lock in a rate until right before closing on a new build. If it gets delayed, we could be in trouble.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Ultimately, we decided to build our home because it was easier than getting into so many bidding wars and will grow in value over time. We are not planning on selling anytime soon, so it made enough financial sense to get this new build.</p>

<h4>Our Move In Date</h4>
<p>We are set to move into our new home in August and can't wait! Enjoy clicking through my site to see what kind of things I recommend if you decide to build a home, too. Building a home is kind of like planning a wedding -- you don't know the best way to do it until after it's all done.</p>
