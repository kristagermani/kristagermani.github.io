    <h2>Interior</h2>
    <p>The interior of our home was the most fun part for me to design, and Robert let me choose everything for the inside of the house. On this page, I will show you the entire process of choosing the materials we used, what the design studio looked like, and the aesthetic that I chose to use throughout our entire home. 
    <p>Please feel free to take a look at my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/singleinthesuburbs/" target="_blank">Instagram Account</a> to follow along with our build journey live. I often post stories while visiting the build site, and post update photos weekly of the progress the builder is making on our home.</p>

    <h3>Our Dream Home</h3>
    <p>
         Before we get started, I'll tell you what kind of design elements I wanted our home to have:
    </p><!--Understood blank space left under closing p tag.-->
    <ol>
        <li>Cool tones throughout the house</li>
        <li>Lots of black, white, and gray with some duty blue acccent pieces</li>
        <li>Modern and chic statement pieces </li>
        <li>Vintage rugs</li>
    </ol>
    </aside>

    <p>I want our home to be clean, not cluttered, and to be a super relaxing place to be. I was surprised that when I began the process, I went for a very light, airy coastal vibe. Once I started thinking about what I really wanted to live with, though, I gravitated toward very neutral colors with some pops of drama by adding in quite a bit of black. I didn't feel like coastal was quite appropriate, as we live about 4 hours from the beach. </p>
    
    <h3>Trip to The Design Studio</h3>
    <p>I went to the design studio three times to get everyhing just the way we wented it. It was a blast getting to see all of the different textures, colors, and finishes. You'll be shocked to see the first palette I chose, versus what we ended up deciding to go with.</p>

    <h4>Floor Options</h4>
    <p>NV Homes uses Armstrong luxury vinyl plan flooring in their homes on the ground level. The upstairs and basements both get covered in carpet unless you want to upgrade. The <a href=" https://www.armstrongflooring.com/residential/en-us/vinyl-flooring.html#" target="_blank">Armstrong&nbsp;Flooring&trade;</a> website has all of the options available for viewing, and you can order a sample to see the different kinds in person.
    <p>The bathrooms get a standard tile, which comes in 4 different colors. Beige, gray, greige, or a textured gray. You can do a different color in each of the bathrooms, but I wanted to keep it all the same so that the house would flow nicely. We did not upgrade any of the tiles, other than the master suite, just for budgeting purposes. </p>
    <figure> 
        <img src="bathroomtile.JPG" width="300 px" alt="four different tile options">
        <figcaption> These are the four different options we had. Going from the bottom, being the beige, the second being the greige, the third is the gray we chose, and the final is the textured gray.
        </figure>
        <p>There were many other options we could have picked, as you can see on the tile wall. There were also drawers upon drawyers of tile, but I didn't bother looking at anything else because I wanted to enjoy what our house came with.</p>

    <h4>Kitchen Options</h4>
    <p>They say the kitchen is the heart of the home, which makes sense because the way to a man's heart is also through food. I love to cook and bake, so choosing things for potentially the most used room in the home was a lot of fun. Our house is <i>very</i> open concept so I will also include a few photos of the living room, which is connected to the kitchen.</p>
    
        <h5>Cabinets</h5>
        <p>Here are a few photos of the transformation in our kitchen:</p>
        <figure> 
            <img src="kitchenreno.JPG" width="300 px" alt="torn up kitchen">
            <figcaption> This was the first time we visited our home and saw the kitchen being built.
            </figure>
    
        <p>We chose white cabinets that are soft closing. Soft close cabinets are more durable, as they are not able to slam shut, and do not hang as heavily on their hinges. This brand is <a href="http://online.fliphtml5.com/tppb/hayl/#p=1" target="_blank">Timberlake cabnitry,</a> which you can find online or at Home Depot. Expect to pay a little more for them, but if you are moving into a home that will be yours for a long length of time, it could be worth the splurge. </p>

        <h5>Countertops</h5>
        <p>We chose between quartz and granite countertops. There are pros and cons to each type. Let me make a list for you to weigh which might be a better fit for your home.</p>

        <h6>Granite Countertops</h6>
        <ul>
            <li>Pro: They have incredible heat resistance. You will see that this isn't necessarily the case with quartz either, so this can be a major pro if you are in the habit of putting hot pans on your countertops.</li>
            <li>Pro: Granite countertops have great scratch resistance.</li>
            <li>Pro: Granite is one of the better options for the environment. There is a lot of granite still available and there is minimal processing that needs to happen to get granite kitchen-ready.</li>
            <li>Con: Granite countertops do need to be maintained. Since they are somewhat porous, they need to be sealed once a year to keep them nice.</li>
            <li>Con: Granite is one of the more expensive countertop options, but over time it does last much longer than laminate, if cared for properly.</li>
        </ul>

        <h6>Quartz Countertops</h6>
        <ul>
            <li>Pro: Quartz counterops are also more environmentally-friendly than most, as quartz is one of the most common substances in the <em>world.</em> This means you are not taking something from the earth that is hard to remake or find.</li>
            <li>Pro: Quartz looks like an expensive marble, but is more durable and more environmentally-friendly. It is also far less expensive than marble. For a kitchen, you should almost always lean to choosing quartz over marble.</li>
            <li>Pro: Quartz is not a porous stone, which means it is easier to clean and get all of the gunk and bacteria off of your countertops. It also means you do not have to seal it ever year like granite, so is easier to maintain. </li>
            <li>Con: Like granite, quartz can be on the pricier end of materials to use. If you are building a home in a new neighborhood, though, you might consider doing the upgrade, as the labor fee and the initial cost for a standard countertop are already in place. It may not be much more to upgrade.</li>
            <li>Con: Quartz is not as heat-resistant as granite, so you need to be careful if you are cooking to not put a hot pan straight on the countertop. You also should never burn candles on a quartz countertop without having something underneath in case the bottom gets hot.</li>
        </ul>

    <p>Ultimately, we chose quartz countertops because we liked the way they looked in our home. They were just a level one upgrade, so were hardly any more on our monthly mortgage. We are planning to keep them the entire time we live in this home -- so we need to be careful to keep the pots and pans far away!</p>

    <figure> 
        <img src="kitchencounter.JPG" width="300 px" alt="white quartz countertop with gray vein">
        <figcaption> I chose the "Calcutta Ultra" countertop, which is a striking white with gray veins.
        </figure>

    <h5>The Sink</h5>
    <p>I needed to put a little blurb about our sink in here because it is shockingly one of the things I am most excited about. Be sure to ask your builder if they have the Kohler Prolific sink. It is a beautiful undermounted sink that comes with a bunch of cool features that seem kind of like something you would see on a cheesy "As Seen on TV" ad. Nevertheless, it was barely even an upgrade, and I liked the undermount better than a white farmhouse style sink.</p>

    <p>No, I'm not done telling you about the sink yet. You can purchase it on your own online, but it's pretty pricy at over $1,000. If you are already paying for a sink and installation, though, it is barely over $100 and is worth the upgrade in the accessories alone. You get a cutting board, strainer, and several other fun little features that make cooking over your sink simple. This makes clean up so easy and allows you to keep all of your mess in the sink. Just don't throw anything big down the disposal! If you are interested in purchasing one for your home or adding it to a new build, check it out on <a href="https://www.us.kohler.com/us/prolific-33-x-17-3-4-x-11-under-mount-single-bowl-kitchen-sink-with-accessories/productDetail/kitchen-sinks/1039650.htm?skuId=1039643&brandId=1092284" target="_blank">on Kohler's official website.</a></p>

        </figure>

        <figcaption> Here is what the sink looks like on Kohler's website. Love seeing it in action!
        </figure>

    <h4>Bathroom Options</h4>
    <p>Our master bathroom is one of the things I am the most excited about in our new house. We did a slightly upgraded tile, which is a white marble with gray vein -- somewhat similar to the kitchen choice. I like tying in everyting to the house together so that there is a nice flow from room to room.</p>
  
    <figure> 
        <img src="bathroom.JPG" width="300 px" alt="white and gray marble shower and bathtub">
        <figcaption> This is in the middle of the grout getting put in.
        </figure>

    <p>As you can see, I chose a regular bathtub instead of a freestanding tub. It was due to a mix of the freestanding tub being more expensive and less comfortable. I actually did not realize that they would be putting marble all over the tub as well, which was the nicest surprise! Whether it was on purpose or by accident, it was a great thing to walk in on when taking a tour of the partly-finished house.</p>

    <figure> 
        <img src="bathroomshower.JPG" width="300 px" alt="white and gray marble shower and brown vanity">
        <figcaption> Here is a photo the project manager sent to us of the shower once the door was put in. To the left is the espresso colored vanity we chose (Because nothing is just "brown" or "white" in design, apparently).
        </figure>

    <p>The shower with the seat is perfect for elderly -- or people who are disabled, like me! I have a hard time taking a shower wihtout feeling faint (a main symptom of POTS is fainting), so this will help keep me safe and happy.</p>

    <p><b>Pro tip:</b>Make sure you actually <i>sit</i> in the bathtub you are planning to buy before purchasing it. There were other tubs I initally thought were prettier, but when I sat in them I just couldn't get comfortable. Taking a bath should be a relaxing experience, so you want to make sure you pick one based on comfort, not just the way it looks.</p>




    <h4>Master Suite</h4>
    <p>The master suite, which is obviously attached to the master bath, has two closets, which is amazing. The last place we stayed together we had to use the closet in the guest room to each have our own. Here is a little tour I took mid-renovation:</p>

    <p>The next step here is getting the carpet installed. I can't wait to see everything all put together!</p>

    <aside>
    <p>One thing I will mention about building a home in a new neighborhood, rather than doing it all on your own is that it is not super expensive to upgrade the materials that they use. We chose to upgrade the countertops in the kitchen and the tile in the bathroom as our two "splurges," but it only adds a few dollars a month to our mortgage.</p>
