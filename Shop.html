    <h3>Interior Designers I Love</h3>
    <p>Having creative designers to look for is great while planning out what you want your home to look like. There are so many different tastes and styles that it is impossible to say that there is a "best" designer, but I will list a few I have drawn inspiration from while creating the aesthetic in our home. I am beginning with chatting a little bit about them, as they are the people who inspired my shopping list. If you want to skip this and scroll straight to "Shop," Click Here. </p>

    <h4>Alison Victoria</h4>
    <p>One of my favorite designers, <a href="https://www.hgtv.com/profiles/talent/alison-victoria/alison-victoria-bio" target="_blank">Alison Victoria,</a> is on the show <i>Windy City Rehab,</i> but I first watched her on <i>Rock The Block.</i> She has a more sophisticated style and is incredibly creative with keeping things simple, but still beautiful. Here is an Instagram post of one of my favorite bathrooms I have ever seen:</p>

    <p>Another one of my favorite designs by Alison was her kitchen in season one of <i>Rock The Block.</i> I found the video on YouTube -- restart it if you would like to see the entire clip, but I began the video to show you the final result of the kitchen.</p>

    <h4>Mina Starsiak Hawk</h4>
    <p>Mina has a very coastal style and has had some amazing outdoor designs. She loves fireplaces and making things cozy in a home. Mina is a star on <i>HGTV</i> as well and has her own design show with her mom, Karen. Here is a little home tour to show you the style <a href="https://www.hgtv.com/profiles/talent/mina-starsiak" target="_blank"> Mina</a> loves so much that she put it in her own home.</p>

    <h4>Tiffany Brooks</h4>
    <p>Tiffany's style is light and fun. I always love the colors she uses (well, actually lots of black and white!) and she is a big fan of fun textures. This year, <a href="https://www.hgtv.com/profiles/talent/tiffany-brooks/tiffany-brooks-bio" target="_blank"> Tiffany </a> hosted the <i>HGTV</i> dream home giveaway and got to design many of the elements that were included. Tiffany would probably be the most fun to work with out of all the designers. Here is a video of one of Tiffany's rooms in this year's dream home:</p>

    <p>I would love to have so much drama in my own kitchen one day. Right now we have lots of neutral white, but I will be putting in some black accent pieces to add contrast to our home.</p>

    <h3>Some of My Favorite Stores</h3>
    <p>Obviously, when you move into a home, you need furniture. We are on a tight budget and decided that we would rather just pace ourselves and get the home we want, but then be very slow in filling it with furniture. The two priority rooms for us will be the kitchen and the adjoining living room. We already have a kitchen table that we got from BJs Wholesale, and a bedroom set we bought years ago at a Macy's annual sale.</p>  
    
    <h4>Costco</h4>
    <p>Costco honestly has the <em>best</em> furniture for a really good price. They have super comfortable couches in the 900s and I got 3 rugs for 3 spaces for less than I would have spent for one rug at La-Z-Boy.</p>

    <h5>Living Room Finds</h5>
    <h6>Mohawk Woven Area Rug in Milica</h6>
    <p>My favorite rug will be for the living room, and is called the  <a href="https://www.costco.com/mohawk-woven-area-rug%2c-milica.product.100649761.html" target="_blank">Mohawk Woven Area Rug, Milica.</a>I even got the rug on sale, which made it under $200! If you wait for a holiday, Costco often has great prices on furniture.</p>
    <figure> 
        <img src="wovenrug.JPG" width="300 px" alt="black and white vintage rug">
        <figcaption>I love that this rug is vibrant, but still looks distressed and vintage.
        </figure>
    <h6>Thomasville Couch</h6>
    <p>We also got a Thomasville couch for our living room from Costco. If you want to purchase anything from Costco or see the prices, you need to have an account, but this <a href="https://www.costco.com/mohawk-woven-area-rug%2c-milica.product.100649761.html" target="_blank">Thomasville couch</a> is currently $999.</p>
    <figure> 
        <img src="couch.JPG" width="300 px" alt="gray sectional couch with studs lining the bottom">
        <figcaption>This couch not only was a good price for such a large one, but is also super comfortable.
        </figure>
    <h5>Bedroom Finds</h5>
    <h6>Dixon King Tufted Headboard</h6>
    <p>I have my eye on a beautiful <a href="https://www.costco.com/dixon-king-tufted-headboard.product.100702869.html" target="_blank">gray headboard</a> at Costco for one of our guest bedrooms. I want to have a comfortable place for our family and friends to come stay, and would love to get this headboard in gray or in cream, then paint the accent wall in the room black to offer some intense contrast. This headboard is regularly $550, so I will wait for a sale to purchase it.</p>
    <figure> 
            <img src="headboard.JPG" width="300 px" alt="gray fabric headboard">
            <figcaption>I would love this in a very soft pink, so may wait to see if that comes in as well.
            </figure>
    
    <h4>Wayfair</h4>
    <p>Wayfair is a great place to shop for inexpensive furniture, and from what I have heard you need to make sure to read the fine print and the reviews to make sure you are getting a quality product. I am waiting to order anything from here until we move into our house because they have a 30 day return window, which I want to be able to make if something does not go in our home or is not good quality.Here are a few things I have had my eye on.</p>
    
    <h5>Living Room Finds</h5>
    <h6>Williston Forge End Tables</h6>
    <p>I love this set of <a href="https://www.wayfair.com/furniture/pdp/williston-forge-lam-end-table-set-with-storage-w001506922.html?piid=1212744488" target="_blank">end tables</a> for our living room. They cost $150 for two, which is the best price I have seen so far, and get 4.5 stars on the site.</p>
    <img src="endtables.JPG" width="300 px" alt="black end tables with x's on the side">
    <figcaption>I like that these are simple but still have a sleek look to them. 
    </figure>

    <h6>Deion Coffee Table</h6>
    <p>I also love this <a href=" https://www.jossandmain.com/furniture/pdp/taya-coffee-table-j001066285.html?piid%5B0%5D=1364182309" target="_blank">modern coffee table</a> from Joss and Main, which is Wayfair's sister site.</p>
    <img src="coffeetable.JPG" width="300 px" alt="black metal coffee table legs with a white faux marble top">
    <figcaption>This table gets 4.8 stars and is a little outside my price range, but I will wait to see if there is a good sale on it later.
