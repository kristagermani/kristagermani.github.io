    <h2>Exterior</h2>
    <p>Since I got to design most of the inside of the home, I wanted Robert to pic out the exterior color palette. He actually chose the <em>exact color scheme</em> I liked best! He went with dark colors -- which was nice along with the interior -- and a beautiful bright red door. 
        <figure> 
            <img src="exteriorcolors.JPG" width="300 px" alt="color palette with black shutters, red door, blue siding, and gray accent pieces">
            <figcaption> Here is the color palette we chose. Our home is not big enough for an accent color, so we only have three differnt colors on our home.

    <p>When building a home, you have to choose priorities. We did prioritize most of our "splurge" items for the inside of the house, but the other dream item we both would have gone for would have been a front porch. We figured the deck in the back yard would make up for that, though!</p>
    <p>Some of Robert's priorities when it came to the exterior of the home were:</p>
    </p><!--Understood blank space left under closing p tag.-->
    <ul>
        <li>Having a nice space to grill </li>
        <li>Having a big seating area so we can host cookouts</li>
        <li>Getting a front porch to sit and have coffee on</li>
    </ul>
    </aside>
    
    <section>
    <p>As I mentioned before, we did have to work with our budget, so we did not end up getting a front porch, but we can still sit side by side on the little concrete space and enjoy one another's company there!</p>

    <h3>Building the Exterior</h3>
    <p>The total build time of the exterior took about 3 months. They are still putting the finishing touches on the house, but I will go ahead and show some progress photos from weekly or bimonthly updates.</p>

        <figcaption>Here is the lumber delivery for getting ready to build our home. 
        </figure> 

    <p>One huge benefit of building a home in a new neighborhood, rather than on your own plot of land, is that you lock in at a price and keep it, whether or not lumber prices go up. This ended up being a huge blessing for us, as lumber prices were crazy this year!</p>

            <img src="foundation.JPG" width="300 px" alt="concrete foundation of a home">
            <figcaption> This part of the home build was really exciting becaue we were able to start seeing an actual house form. The foundation is a very important part and took a few weeks for them to finish.

        <h2>Yard</h2>
        <h3>Our Ideas for a Deck</h3>
        <p>The yard is still a little bit of a question mark for what exactly we want to do. We will definitely install a deck where there is a door leading to nowhere, and are using <a href="https://battlefielddecks.com/" target="_blank">Battlefield Decks</a> as our builder. If you are building in Gainesville or Haymarket, you should definitely contact Bill Jarvis at <a href="1-703-568-3879">703-568-3879</a> to get a quote on a deck or patio for your home.</p>
        <p>We are planning on doing a Trex deck, and are leaning towards doing a light gray deck with darker gray railings.</p>
        </article>
        
        <h3>Building the Yard</h3>
        <p>You don't usually realize that when a home is built, all of the grass has been dug up and needs to be replaced. Here is our yard transformation thus far.</p>  
        
        <figure> 
            <img src="yardbefore.JPG" width="300 px" alt="dirty yard with blue house on land">
            <figcaption> This is the yard before they planted any trees or grass.
            </figure>
    
            <figure> 
                <img src="yardafter.JPG" width="300 px" alt="sod grass yard with blue house on land">
                <figcaption> Here is the yard after they put the sod down.
                </figure>
    
    <h2>Our Land</h2>
    <p>When you purchase a plat of land in a neighborhood, your home obviously will take up a good portion of it. We got the smallest home available, <em>(fun fact: the three windows on the bottom right are a garage, not part of the house!)</em> which does mean that we get a bigger yard than we would have if we had more square footage in our home.</p>
    <p>We also had to have our land leveled according to what would be good with the county. This is to decrease the risk of flooding or other issues in our home in the future. We have a plat guide that shows all of the levels of our land. I don't really understand it well enough to explain what it is, so attached a downloadable link for you to look at if you are interested.</p>

    <p>If you want to take a look at our lot, feel free to download the plat here:</p>
